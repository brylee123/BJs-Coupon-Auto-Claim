# BJs-Coupon-Auto-Claim
This is a quick JavaScript Bookmarklet to claim all coupons from BJ's.

How do I use this?
1. Create a bookmark and set the URL to the code inside the .js file. No need to download anything!
2. Navigate to this URL: https://www.bjs.com/myCoupons
3. Scroll all the way to the bottom so the page expands and displays all the coupons.
4. Click on the bookmark and let it run!

Warning: There is a delay before the script is run. It also does a batch of 60 at a time, this might be a client-side restriction.
